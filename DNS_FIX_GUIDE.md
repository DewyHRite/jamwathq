# DNS Configuration Fix for www.jamwathq.com

## Problem
GitHub Pages is showing: "www.jamwathq.com is improperly configured - Domain's DNS record could not be retrieved (InvalidDNSError)"

## Root Cause
The `www.jamwathq.com` subdomain has **NO DNS record** configured in Hostinger.

## Current DNS Status
✅ **jamwathq.com** - Working (has A records pointing to GitHub Pages)
❌ **www.jamwathq.com** - Not working (no DNS record exists)

## The Fix: Add CNAME Record in Hostinger

### Step 1: Log In to Hostinger
1. Go to https://www.hostinger.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to **Domains** section

### Step 2: Select Your Domain
1. Find `jamwathq.com` in your domain list
2. Click on it to manage

### Step 3: Access DNS Management
1. Look for one of these options:
   - **DNS Zone**
   - **DNS / Nameservers**
   - **Manage DNS**
   - **DNS Records**
2. Click to access DNS settings

### Step 4: Add CNAME Record
Click **Add Record** or **Add New Record** button

**Enter these values:**
```
Record Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target/Value/Points to: dewyhrite.github.io
TTL: 3600 (or leave as default/automatic)
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- ⚠️ Use `dewyhrite.github.io` NOT `dewyhrite.github.io.` (no trailing dot)
- ⚠️ Name should be just `www` NOT `www.jamwathq.com`
- ⚠️ Some providers might show it as `www.jamwathq.com` automatically - that's OK

### Step 5: Save Changes
1. Click **Save** or **Add Record**
2. Wait for confirmation message

### Step 6: Verify DNS Records
After adding, you should see these records in Hostinger:

```
Type    Name    Value/Target              TTL
────────────────────────────────────────────────
A       @       185.199.108.153           3600
A       @       185.199.109.153           3600
A       @       185.199.110.153           3600
A       @       185.199.111.153           3600
CNAME   www     dewyhrite.github.io       3600
```

## DNS Propagation Timeline

**After you add the CNAME record:**
- **Immediate**: Changes saved in Hostinger
- **5-15 minutes**: DNS starts propagating globally
- **15-30 minutes**: Most locations can see the change
- **Up to 48 hours**: Maximum propagation time (rare)

**Typical wait time: 15-30 minutes**

## Testing Your DNS Configuration

### Method 1: Command Line (Windows)
Open Command Prompt and run:
```cmd
nslookup www.jamwathq.com 8.8.8.8
```

**Before fix (current):**
```
*** dns.google can't find www.jamwathq.com: Non-existent domain
```

**After fix (what you should see):**
```
Name:    www.jamwathq.com
Address: dewyhrite.github.io points to GitHub Pages IPs
```

### Method 2: Online DNS Checker
Visit: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter: `www.jamwathq.com`
- Check: CNAME record
- Should show: `dewyhrite.github.io`

### Method 3: Browser Test
After DNS propagates, test these URLs:
```
http://jamwathq.com         ✅ Should work
http://www.jamwathq.com     ✅ Should work (after DNS fix)
https://jamwathq.com        ⏳ Will work after SSL certificate
https://www.jamwathq.com    ⏳ Will work after SSL certificate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: DNS changes not taking effect after 30 minutes

**Check:**
1. Verify CNAME record is saved in Hostinger
2. Ensure target is `dewyhrite.github.io` (no typos)
3. Clear your DNS cache:
   ```cmd
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```
4. Try testing from different device or network

### Issue: GitHub Pages still shows DNS error

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5 more minutes (GitHub checks DNS every few minutes)
2. Remove and re-add custom domain in GitHub Pages:
   - Go to: https://github.com/DewyHRite/jamwathq/settings/pages
   - Remove `jamwathq.com` from Custom domain field
   - Wait 1 minute
   - Add `jamwathq.com` back
   - Click Save

### Issue: CNAME record not appearing in Hostinger

**Common causes:**
- Wrong DNS zone (check you're editing jamwathq.com)
- Using @ instead of www for Name field
- Forgot to click Save
- Browser cache - try refreshing page

## What Happens After DNS Fix

Once the CNAME record is added and propagated:

1. ✅ **www.jamwathq.com resolves** - DNS error disappears in GitHub Pages
2. ✅ **Both domains work** - jamwathq.com and www.jamwathq.com both load your site
3. ⏳ **SSL certificate requested** - GitHub will request certificate for www subdomain
4. ⏳ **HTTPS becomes available** - Certificate issued in 1-24 hours
5. ✅ **Enforce HTTPS enabled** - You can enable HTTPS enforcement

## Expected Timeline

| Time | Status |
|------|--------|
| Now | ❌ www.jamwathq.com shows DNS error |
| +5 min | Add CNAME record in Hostinger |
| +15 min | ⏳ DNS propagating |
| +30 min | ✅ www.jamwathq.com DNS resolves |
| +1 hour | ✅ GitHub detects DNS, starts SSL process |
| +4 hours | ✅ SSL certificate issued |
| +24 hours | ✅ HTTPS fully working |
