							<h2>J-1 (BrigdeUSA) Program</h2>
							<p>The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is a U.S. program for nonimmigrant visas that promotes international education and culture. 
							It welcomes international participants to the US for professional training, academic study, teaching, research, or cultural activities. 
							The State Department authorizes a network of public and private entities as program sponsors. The J-1 visa has many categories for diverse participant characteristics and goals. 
							Intern/trainee, student/secondary school, teacher, professor, researcher, specialist, and cultural programs like Au Pair, Camp Counselor, and Summer Work Travel are common. 
							Each category is meant to help participants enter the U.S. in a way that fosters personal growth and cultural interchange. 
							The sponsor's DS-2019 form (Certificate of Eligibility) is essential, confirming the participant's program, stay, and J-1 visa eligibility. 
							Employers and schools provide a practical environment for participants to work, study, and experience U.S. workplace culture. 
							Cultural interchange is a key component of the J-1 program, encouraging participants to learn about American culture and share their own. 
							SEVIS tracks J-1 participants' status, compliance, and movements during their stay to ensure the program meets its goals and host organizations meet regulatory requirements.</p>
