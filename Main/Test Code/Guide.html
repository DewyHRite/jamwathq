                                        <section>
                                            <strong>Before You Begin:</strong> Gather your documents—ensure you have a valid passport (with at least six months of validity beyond your intended stay), a digital passport-style photograph that meets U.S. visa specifications, your travel itinerary (if available), and any supporting documents (evidence of financial ties or employment details). Also, set up a reliable internet connection and use a supported browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) as the DS-160 website works best on modern browsers. In Kingston, Jamaica, be prepared with a backup connection to avoid interruptions.
