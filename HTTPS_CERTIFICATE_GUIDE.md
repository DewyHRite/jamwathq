# HTTPS Certificate Provisioning Guide
**Domain**: jamwathq.com
**Issue**: "Enforce HTTPS ‚Äî Unavailable for your site because a certificate has not yet been issued"
**Status**: ‚è≥ **NORMAL** - Certificate is being provisioned

---

## ‚úÖ What's Happening (This is Normal!)

GitHub Pages is automatically provisioning a **FREE SSL certificate** from Let's Encrypt for your custom domain (jamwathq.com).

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ DNS is configured correctly (jamwathq.com resolves to GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Custom domain is verified in GitHub Pages
- ‚è≥ **SSL certificate is being provisioned** (this takes time)
- ‚è≥ "Enforce HTTPS" option will appear once certificate is ready

---

## ‚è∞ How Long Does It Take?

### Typical Timeline:
- **Minimum**: 15-30 minutes
- **Average**: 1-4 hours
- **Maximum**: 24-48 hours (rare, but possible)

### Factors That Affect Time:
1. **DNS Propagation**: If DNS was just configured, GitHub needs to see it propagated
2. **Let's Encrypt Processing**: Certificate authority needs to verify domain ownership
3. **GitHub Queue**: Number of certificate requests being processed
4. **Domain Verification**: GitHub verifies you own jamwathq.com via DNS

---

## üîç What GitHub is Doing Right Now

1. **Verifying DNS**: Checking that jamwathq.com points to GitHub Pages IPs
2. **Domain Ownership**: Confirming you control jamwathq.com via CNAME/A records
3. **Certificate Request**: Requesting SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
4. **Certificate Installation**: Installing certificate on GitHub's servers
5. **HTTPS Enablement**: Enabling HTTPS option once certificate is active

---

## ‚úÖ How to Check Status

### Method 1: GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/DewyHRite/jamwathq/settings/pages
2. Under **Custom domain**, look for messages:
   - ‚è≥ "Certificate being provisioned..." - Wait
   - ‚úÖ "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox appears - Ready!

### Method 2: Visit Your Website
1. Try visiting: https://jamwathq.com (with https://)
2. **If you see**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Your connection is not private" - Certificate not ready yet (NORMAL)
   - ‚úÖ Green padlock - Certificate is ready!

### Method 3: Command Line Check
```bash
# Check if certificate is installed
curl -I https://jamwathq.com

# If certificate is ready, you'll see:
# HTTP/2 200
# server: GitHub.com

# If not ready yet, you'll see SSL error (NORMAL)
```

### Method 4: Online SSL Checker
- Tool: https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html
- Enter: jamwathq.com
- **If certificate exists**: Shows details
- **If not ready**: Shows error (wait longer)

---

## ‚è≥ What to Do While Waiting

### DO:
- ‚úÖ **Wait patiently** (this is automatic, no action needed)
- ‚úÖ Test your site via http://jamwathq.com (works fine)
- ‚úÖ Continue testing functionality
- ‚úÖ Check back every few hours
- ‚úÖ Work on other tasks

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Don't remove and re-add custom domain (this resets the process!)
- ‚ùå Don't change DNS records (unless they're wrong)
- ‚ùå Don't repeatedly save settings (doesn't speed it up)
- ‚ùå Don't worry - this is completely normal!

## üéØ Expected Behavior by Hour

### Hour 0-1 (DNS Just Configured):
```
Status: Certificate being provisioned
Message: "Enforce HTTPS unavailable"
http://jamwathq.com: ‚úÖ Works
https://jamwathq.com: ‚ö†Ô∏è SSL error (expected)
Action: Keep waiting
```

### Hour 1-4 (DNS Fully Propagated):
```
Status: Certificate being issued
Message: Still "Enforce HTTPS unavailable"
http://jamwathq.com: ‚úÖ Works
https://jamwathq.com: ‚ö†Ô∏è SSL error (expected)
Action: Keep waiting, check occasionally
```

### Hour 4-24 (Certificate Issued):
```
Status: Certificate installed
Message: ‚úÖ "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox appears!
http://jamwathq.com: ‚úÖ Works
https://jamwathq.com: ‚úÖ Works with green padlock!
Action: Enable "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox
```

## üîß Troubleshooting (If It Takes More Than 24 Hours)

### Step 1: Verify DNS is Correct

Check DNS records are exactly right:

```bash
nslookup jamwathq.com
```

**Should return**:
```
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    jamwathq.com
Addresses:  185.199.108.153
            185.199.109.153
            185.199.110.153
            185.199.111.153
```

**If wrong**: Fix DNS records in Hostinger, wait another 24 hours.

---

### Step 2: Verify CNAME Record for www

```bash
nslookup www.jamwathq.com
```

**Should return**:
```
www.jamwathq.com    canonical name = dewyhrite.github.io
```

**If wrong**: Fix CNAME record in Hostinger.

---

### Step 3: Check Global DNS Propagation

- Tool: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/jamwathq.com
- **Should see**: Green checkmarks globally with GitHub IPs
- **If red X's**: DNS not fully propagated, wait longer

---

### Step 4: Verify CNAME File in Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/DewyHRite/jamwathq
2. Check `CNAME` file exists in root
3. Open it - should contain exactly: `jamwathq.com`
4. **If wrong**: Fix and push to GitHub

---

### Step 5: Remove and Re-add Custom Domain (Last Resort)

**Only do this if it's been 48+ hours**:

1. Go to: https://github.com/DewyHRite/jamwathq/settings/pages
2. Under **Custom domain**, click the X to remove jamwathq.com
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Re-enter: `jamwathq.com`
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait another 24 hours for certificate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Certificate Issues (and Solutions)

### Issue 1: "Certificate not valid for domain"
**Cause**: Certificate issued for wrong domain
**Solution**:
1. Check CNAME file contains exactly: `jamwathq.com` (no www, no https)
2. Remove and re-add custom domain in GitHub settings

---

### Issue 2: "Mixed Content Warning"
**Cause**: Some resources loading via HTTP instead of HTTPS
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Update any hardcoded `http://` links to `https://`
3. Or use protocol-relative URLs: `//example.com/script.js`

---

### Issue 3: "Certificate Expired"
**Cause**: GitHub didn't auto-renew certificate
**Solution**:
1. This is rare - GitHub auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates
2. Remove and re-add custom domain to trigger new certificate
3. Contact GitHub Support if persists

---

### Issue 4: Still Says "Unavailable" After 48 Hours
**Possible Causes**:
1. DNS not fully propagated
2. DNS records incorrect
3. CNAME file missing or wrong
4. Domain not verified

**Solution**:
1. Verify DNS with `nslookup jamwathq.com`
2. Check CNAME file in repository
3. Check DNS propagation at whatsmydns.net
4. Remove and re-add custom domain
5. Contact GitHub Support
