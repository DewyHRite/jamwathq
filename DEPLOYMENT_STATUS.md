## 🌐 Current URLs

### GitHub Pages URL (Active):
- **Primary**: https://dewyhrite.github.io/jamwathq/
- **Status**: ✅ LIVE - Should show your homepage

### Custom Domain (Pending DNS):
- **Domain**: jamwathq.com
- **Status**: ⏳ Waiting for Hostinger DNS configuration
- **CNAME File**: ✅ Created and pushed to GitHub

---

## 📋 Next Steps for Custom Domain

### 1. Configure Hostinger DNS (15 minutes)

Log into Hostinger and add these DNS records:

**A Records** (add all 4):
```
Type: A | Name: @ | Value: 185.199.108.153 | TTL: 3600
Type: A | Name: @ | Value: 185.199.109.153 | TTL: 3600
Type: A | Name: @ | Value: 185.199.110.153 | TTL: 3600
Type: A | Name: @ | Value: 185.199.111.153 | TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record** (for www):
```
Type: CNAME | Name: www | Value: dewyhrite.github.io | TTL: 3600
```

**Guide**: See `docs/HOSTINGER_DNS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

---

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Custom Domain (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/DewyHRite/jamwathq/settings/pages
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter: `jamwathq.com`
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait for DNS check (may take a few minutes after DNS propagates)
5. Once DNS check passes, enable ☑ **Enforce HTTPS**

---

### 3. Wait for DNS Propagation (1-24 hours)

DNS changes can take time to propagate globally.

**Check Status**:
- https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/jamwathq.com
- Should show GitHub IP addresses (185.199.108-111.153)

**Test Locally** (Windows):
```cmd
nslookup jamwathq.com
```
Should return GitHub IP addresses.

## 💡 Important Notes

### Why the Initial Deployment Didn't Work:
The frontend files were in a `frontend/` subfolder. GitHub Pages requires `index.html` to be in the **root directory** of your repository.

### What Changed:
```
❌ Before (didn't work):
jamwathq/
└── frontend/
    ├── index.html
    └── ...

✅ After (works!):
jamwathq/
├── index.html
├── about.html
└── ...
```

### Lesson Learned:
**Always put your static website files in the root of your GitHub repository for GitHub Pages!**
