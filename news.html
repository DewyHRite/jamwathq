                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The Trump administration's decision to raise the H-1B visa application fee to US$100,000 has sparked concern among immigration attorneys and Jamaican professionals. Experts warn that the steep cost could deter U.S. employers from hiring foreign talent, pushing skilled Jamaicans to seek opportunities in countries like Canada and China. The Chinese government recently launched a sponsor-free K-Visa to attract STEM professionals. Attorneys also caution that smaller U.S. firms may struggle to afford the new fee, and scams targeting hopeful applicants could rise amid the uncertainty. Remote work and outsourcing may increase, but data security remains a concern.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The U.S. government has postponed the implementation of a US$250 surcharge on non-immigrant visas, originally scheduled for October 1, 2025. Immigration attorney Oliver Langstadt suggests the delay stems from logistical challenges at consular posts and embassies. The surcharge, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would apply only to successful visa applicants from non-waiver countries like Jamaica. It aims to fund immigration enforcement and border security, and is refundable if visa holders comply with all terms. However, no clear repayment mechanism has been outlined, and the Department of Homeland Security could activate the fee at any time.

                  This investigative report reveals how the U.S. J-1 visa program, originally designed for cultural exchange, has become a pipeline for cheap labor. Foreign workers from countries like Kosovo, Brazil, and South Africa were lured with promises of training and cultural immersion, only to face grueling hours, unsafe conditions, and threats of deportation. The article documents cases of physical injury, sexual harassment, wage theft, and systemic neglect by sponsors and employers. Despite repeated warnings and lawsuits, oversight remains weak, allowing exploitation to persist across industries from agriculture to architecture.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The New York Times investigation uncovers widespread abuse within the J-1 visa program, which was intended to foster cultural exchange. Instead, many young foreign workers were assigned menial and degrading jobs such as packing dog food in Iowa and cleaning pig pens in Nebraska. The program's lack of oversight has allowed employers to exploit these workers, often under threat of deportation. The findings raise serious concerns about the role of the State Department and the integrity of the program.

                  Britney Wheatle, a 21-year-old J-1 visa holder, was arrested in August 2023 for abandoning her newborn
                  baby in a North Myrtle Beach neighborhood. The infant survived after being discovered by a resident.
                  Recently, charges against Wheatle were dismissed, and she will not face jail time. This case has
                  sparked discussions on the challenges foreign workers face, as well as legal and social support
                  systems available to J-1 visa holders.

                  H-1B cap, including the advanced degree exemption (master’s cap). Beneficiaries with properly
                  submitted registrations have been randomly selected and notified that they are eligible to file an

                  pertains to eligibility to file an H-1B cap-subject petition, and additional evidence may be required
                  for petition approval.

                  Sanjay Anderson, President of First Class Cultural Travel Experience, is working to ensure Jamaica
                  remains a key participant in the US work-and-travel program. His company hosted an orientation event
                  to prepare over 800 students for employment opportunities in America. Anderson highlighted challenges
                  with Jamaican students’ workplace attitudes, stressing that employers favor those with strong work
                  ethics. He also addressed concerns about fraudulent agencies scamming students, urging continued
                  improvements to protect the program's longevity. Anderson's agency, founded in 2019, has grown
                  rapidly, sending an increasing number of students to the US annually. He remains committed to
                  maintaining affordability for participants while fostering a sustainable future for Jamaican
                  work-and-travel hopefuls.

                  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced final rules for the H-1B and H-2 nonimmigrant
                  visa programs, set to take effect on January 17, 2025. USCIS will also release a revised Form I-129,
                  Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on the same date, reflecting combined regulatory changes. The H-1B
                  rule modernizes the program by improving flexibility for employers and strengthening integrity
                  measures. The H-2 rule enhances worker protections, imposing penalties on companies that violate labor
                  laws. USCIS has confirmed that from January 17 onward, only the latest edition of Form I-129 (dated
                  01/17/25) will be accepted. Any petitions submitted using the previous 04/01/24 edition on or after
                  this date will be rejected.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The alleged work-and-travel fraud involving First Rio continues to escalate as additional students
                  come forward. Initially affecting nearly 100 students, another group of six has now revealed they also
                  lost significant amounts of money after paying fees for promised job placements in the US. Despite
                  earlier assurances of full refunds, the affected students have yet to receive their money. First Rio's
                  owner, Christelle Bernard, reportedly partnered with another agency to generate funds for repayments,
                  but progress has been slow. Some students are hesitant to roll their payments over to next year's
                  program due to distrust. Authorities urge those affected to file official complaints to assist in
                  ongoing investigations.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The St. Ann police are urging approximately 75 individuals who were allegedly defrauded by First Rio,
                  a Work and Travel agency, to file official reports to aid an ongoing investigation. Around 80 students
                  were denied employment in the US for the 2024 summer period, with many facing significant financial
                  losses. Despite the agency withholding over USD $150,000, only five students have reported the matter
                  to authorities. Law enforcement is actively searching for the agency's owner, Christelle Bernard, and
                  an arrest warrant is in place. Investigators are working to determine if Bernard has left the island,
                  while affected students are encouraged to consult the Ministry of Labour for verified employment
                  agencies.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The US Embassy in Kingston has implemented the Jamaican Temporary Worker Safety Programme (JTWSP) to
                  regulate recruitment practices for H-2B, J-1, and Q-1 visa applicants. Effective January 1, 2025, all
                  applicants must provide recruiter details in their DS-160 visa applications. The embassy will verify
                  recruiters against official lists from Jamaica’s Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the US
                  Department of Labor. Applications linked to unregistered recruiters will be rejected, requiring
                  applicants to reapply with approved agencies. The measure seeks to curb fraudulent recruitment,
                  unauthorized employment, and labour exploitation. Additionally, the Ministry of Labour has advised
                  applicants not to pay recruiters without verifying their credentials. The US Embassy warns that visa
                  fraud may result in permanent ineligibility for US visas.

                  The US Embassy in Kingston has announced the Jamaican Temporary Worker Security Program, set to take
                  effect on January 1, 2025. This initiative aims to crack down on unregistered foreign job recruiters
                  exploiting Jamaican workers. Under the new rules, H-2B, J-1, and Q-1 visa applicants must provide
                  complete recruiter information in their DS-160 visa applications. Applications missing these details
                  will be suspended until corrected. Exceptions may be granted for applicants with recent work-travel
                  experience or direct employer sponsorship. The US Embassy warns that unauthorized job placements have
                  led to labor trafficking and debt bondage, putting workers at risk. Authorities will verify recruiters
                  against official lists from Jamaica's Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the US Department of
                  Labor. Any applications linked to unregistered recruiters will be rejected, requiring applicants to

                  The United States Embassy in Kingston has introduced the Jamaican Temporary Worker Security Programme,
                  effective January 1, 2025, in response to concerns about unregistered foreign labour recruiters. Under
                  the new rules, applicants for H-2B, J-1, and Q-1 visas must disclose their recruiting agency
                  information when completing visa applications. The embassy will verify recruiters against official
                  lists from the Jamaica Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the US Department of Labour.
                  Applications missing this information or linked to unregistered recruiters will be rejected.
                  Exceptions apply to applicants directly petitioned by US employers. The embassy also reminded
                  Jamaicans that unregistered recruiting activities violate national employment laws. These measures aim
                  to protect workers from exploitation, labour trafficking, and unauthorized employment arrangements.

                  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Department of State, has
                  released an updated list of countries eligible to participate in the H-2A and H-2B visa programs for
                  temporary agricultural and non-agricultural work. Effective November 8, 2024, Belize has been added to
                  the list, while no countries have been removed. The eligibility list, published in the Federal
                  Register, is valid until November 7, 2025. USCIS typically approves visa petitions only for nationals
                  of designated countries but may grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis if deemed in the U.S.
                  interest. The DHS retains the authority to amend the list based on compliance, fraud concerns, and
                  visa overstay rates.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The Passport Work and Travel Services Limited, founded in 2022 by Ravaine Mullings, is dedicated to
                  restoring trust in Jamaica’s travel industry. Drawing from his experiences as an international
                  student, Mullings created a service catering to visa assistance, work and travel programs, and study
                  abroad opportunities. Within two years, the company expanded its offerings to include truck driver and
                  forklift programs, securing authorization from Jamaica’s Ministry of Labour. Mullings credits his
                  agency’s success to transparent policies, such as charging placement fees only after securing job
                  positions. With a physical office in Kingston and strong international partnerships, the agency has
                  helped over 2,000 clients achieve their travel goals while reinforcing confidence in overseas
                  employment programs.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The International Student Affairs and Travel Services (ISATS) faces mounting criticism from university
                  students who claim the agency failed to deliver promised work-and-travel placements. Several students
                  allege poor communication, broken promises, and unreturned fees amounting to thousands of US dollars.
                  ISATS denies wrongdoing, blaming external factors such as employer declines and embassy closures.
                  However, affected students argue that ISATS’ actions—or lack thereof—have caused serious financial
                  hardship, with some unable to repay loans or cover tuition costs. While ISATS promises refunds,
                  students remain skeptical as deadlines continue to be missed. The US Embassy in Kingston clarified
                  that visa processing has not been unexpectedly delayed, contradicting ISATS’ claims about
                  embassy-related disruptions. Investigations are ongoing.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The International Student Affairs and Travel Services (ISATS) is under scrutiny after failing to
                  deliver promised work-and-travel placements for Jamaican university students. Many students, who paid
                  between US$1,639 and US$1,910 to participate in the program, have been unable to secure jobs and have
                  yet to receive refunds. ISATS claims external factors, including employer declines and US Embassy
                  scheduling, contributed to the issues. However, the affected students argue that the company’s lack of
                  communication and repeated delays in refunds have caused severe financial hardship. Some students now
                  face debt and risk being unable to afford tuition for upcoming semesters. The US Embassy in Kingston
                  denied any unexpected closures and stated that visa processing timelines have returned to normal,
                  contradicting ISATS’ claims.

                  The J-1 Summer Work Travel (SWT) programme offers students and recent graduates the chance to work in
                  the US while exploring a new culture. Participants find employment in summer camps, restaurants,
                  hotels, and theme parks. In 2023, Jamaica ranked third among participating countries, with over 7,500
                  J-1 visas issued by the US Embassy in Kingston. To qualify, applicants must be enrolled full-time in a
                  post-secondary academic institution and meet documentation requirements, including passports, DS-160
                  forms, and SEVIS fee receipts. The embassy encourages early applications, noting that typical wait
                  times for J-1 visa interviews are less than a week. Renewals may qualify for an interview waiver,
                  though some applicants may be required to attend interviews.

                  The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy manual to
                  clarify the two-year foreign residence requirement for nonimmigrant exchange visitors on J-1 visas.
                  The policy explains how USCIS determines compliance with this requirement, the types of evidence
                  benefit requestors may submit, and considerations for cases where fulfilling the requirement is
                  effectively impossible. Additionally, USCIS corrected an omission related to foreign medical
                  graduates' waiver eligibility, clarifying employment requirements for affected individuals. The
                  guidance is effective immediately and aims to improve understanding of J-1 visa compliance and waiver
                  procedures.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The Jamaica Union of Tertiary Students (JUTS) is urging authorities to provide legal and psychosocial
                  support for Jamaican J-1 visa holder Britney Wheatle, who was arrested in South Carolina after
                  allegedly abandoning her newborn baby. JUTS President Christina Williams called on the Jamaican
                  consulate in Miami to assist Wheatle while urging placement agencies to help. The organization
                  emphasized the importance of sensitivity and empathy in handling the case. Williams also encouraged
                  other J-1 students to seek help if they encounter difficulties. The South Carolina Department of
                  Social Services confirmed that the infant is in emergency custody, and the state’s Daniel's Law allows
                  parents to safely surrender newborns without legal repercussions.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  Jamaican students enrolled in the US J-1 work-and-travel programme have expressed concerns following
                  the arrest of 21-year-old participant Britney Wheatle. Wheatle was charged in South Carolina after
                  allegedly abandoning her newborn baby. While some students worry about stricter screening procedures,
                  others argue that this incident should not define the Jamaican student community participating in the
                  programme. Deshawn Cooke, a graduate student at The University of the West Indies, highlighted the
                  need for better emotional support for students. Mark Foster, CEO of a J-1 travel agency, reassured
                  students that this isolated event would not impact the overall programme. Authorities continue to
                  monitor the situation.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  Jamaican student Britney Wheatle, 21, has been charged in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, after
                  allegedly abandoning her newborn daughter in bushes. She was arrested at her workplace and confessed
                  to leaving the baby after giving birth in an apartment nearby. A local resident found the infant, who
                  was naked and lying in the dirt, and called authorities. Wheatle remains in custody with bond set at
                  US$10,000. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison. The case has raised concerns about
                  support systems for J-1 visa holders and the challenges faced by international students working
                  abroad.

                  USCIS has expanded premium processing for applicants filing Form I-539 to change their status to F-1,
                  F-2, M-1, M-2, J-1, or J-2. This phased implementation allows certain applicants to submit Form I-907
                  for expedited processing starting June 13, 2023, for those with pending Form I-539 applications.
                  Beginning June 26, 2023, applicants submitting Form I-539 along with Form I-907 may also request
                  premium processing. The initiative aims to enhance efficiency while adhering to the Emergency Stopgap
                  USCIS Stabilization Act, ensuring premium processing does not negatively impact other immigration
                  requests. Applicants must complete biometric submissions before premium processing begins.

                  The wait time for US visa appointments in Jamaica has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Deputy
                  Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, Julie Stufft, credited workforce expansions and application
                  process efficiencies for the improvement. The H-2 temporary worker and J-1 Summer Work and Travel
                  programmes were key discussion points during her visit. Ambassador N. Nick Perry highlighted that
                  Jamaica is second only to Mexico in the number of H-2 workers going to the US annually. Extensive use
                  of the interview waiver programme has also helped expedite the processing of applicant visas.

                  The US Embassy in Jamaica, which processes the highest number of Summer Work and Travel (SWT)
                  applicants worldwide, has outlined key requirements for eligibility. Applicants must be full-time
                  students at accredited post-secondary institutions and have completed at least one semester. The
                  program duration is limited to four months, and students must present official transcripts or progress
                  reports at their visa interview. Essential application documents include a valid passport, DS-160 visa
                  application form, DS-2019 form, SEVIS fee receipt, and proof of student status. The embassy has
                  expanded appointment availability and advises applicants to apply early to secure a visa slot before
                  their program start date.

                  The number of Jamaicans participating in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security's Overseas
                  Employment Programme increased significantly in 2021, with 16,019 persons benefiting—up 24.8% from the
                  previous year. The programme facilitates employment opportunities in the United States and Canada
                  across various sectors, including farm work and hospitality. The US programmes saw a 21.2% rise in
                  participants, while Canadian programmes grew by 27.2%. Despite women experiencing an 83.5% increase in
                  participation, the programme remains male-dominated. Additionally, private employment agencies placed
                  over 4,000 Jamaicans in overseas jobs.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  Students who enrolled in the US J-1 visa summer work-and-travel programme through Miracle Travel
                  Limited faced financial losses after the company failed to secure placements. Many CMU students paid
                  fees ranging from US$900 to US$2,000, hoping to travel in 2020. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic
                  halted international travel, refunds were promised but never fulfilled. Attempts to contact the
                  agency’s manager, Philan Minott, were unsuccessful, with students alleging poor communication and lack
                  of transparency. Some students tracked down Minott’s family members seeking assistance, but little
                  progress was made. The Ministry of Labour and police have advised affected students to file formal
                  complaints to trigger investigations.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The work-and-travel program remains in limbo as Jamaicans hoping to secure a J-1 visa continue to face
                  uncertainty. The Trump-era ban on the J-1 visa expired, but the Biden administration has yet to
                  provide clarity on its renewal. With appointment dates at the US Embassy in Kingston being set for
                  September, students and workers eagerly awaiting updates are growing anxious. Many have paid upwards
                  of $250,000 to participate in the program but fear they may lose their investment if approvals do not
                  come in time.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The Jamaican government is considering suspending H2B and J-1 work and travel programmes due to
                  COVID-19 concerns. Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett stated that allowing travel could make it
                  difficult to contain the spread of the virus. While no formal announcements have been made, the
                  tightening of global restrictions suggests a pause is likely. Many Jamaican workers participating in
                  these programmes are employed in the hotel sector, which has been severely impacted by reduced
                  international travel. Hotels, facing limited guest occupancy, may not require additional workers,
                  further complicating the situation for seasonal employees.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  The J-1 Summer Work Travel programme allows foreign students to live and work in the United States
                  during summer vacations while experiencing American culture. The programme is popular among Jamaican
                  university students, with many participants returning multiple times. Unlike some misconceptions,
                  students do not need to pay local agency fees in Jamaica, as designated US sponsors handle job
                  placement, visa paperwork, and insurance arrangements. Common jobs include service positions at
                  resorts, hotels, restaurants, and amusement parks. Participants are protected under US labour laws,
                  with rights such as fair wages and protections against workplace abuse. Students are encouraged to
                  apply early, review visa requirements carefully, and seek advice from experienced J-1 participants for
                  a successful experience.

                  <strong>Article Summary:</strong>
                  Opposition Spokesperson on Youth and Culture, Lisa Hanna, has called on the Jamaican government to
                  clarify whether US President Donald Trump’s recent immigration orders could affect Jamaican students
                  seeking employment through the J-1 visa programme. Hanna expressed concerns that broad language in the
                  executive order could restrict access for students reliant on the program to finance their education
                  and gain work experience. She urged the government to address the uncertainty and provide guidance for
                  students preparing for summer employment in the US, questioning how Jamaica would absorb the increased
                  demand for jobs if students were denied access to the program.

                  J1 Financier International Limited, founded by O'Brian Morris alongside co-founders Jevaughn Rose and
                  Rolando Green, has grown into a major financial support system for Jamaican students participating in
                  overseas work and travel programs. Originally started as a favor among friends, the loan agency now
                  provides funding for program fees, airfare, housing deposits, and tax-filing services. The business,
                  which operates out of 1 Stanton Terrace, Kingston, has expanded rapidly, doubling the number of
                  clients it serves. In addition to student loans, the young entrepreneurs have made charitable
                  contributions, including a $300,000 donation for emergency medical assistance. The founders, currently
                  completing degrees at UTech, aim to introduce interest-free loan options to further assist students.

                  Five Jamaican students employed at Walmart in Walton County, Florida, were arrested and charged with
                  retail theft and conspiracy to commit fraud. Deputies responded to reports of store employees stealing
                  merchandise between August 11 and 22. The group allegedly worked together to remove items from

          <h2>J-1 (BrigdeUSA) Program</h2>
          <p>
            The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is a U.S. program for nonimmigrant visas that promotes international
            education and culture. It welcomes international participants to the US for professional training, academic
            study, teaching, research, or cultural activities. The State Department authorizes a network of public and
            private entities as program sponsors. The J-1 visa has many categories for diverse participant
            characteristics and goals. Intern/trainee, student/secondary school, teacher, professor, researcher,
            specialist, and cultural programs like Au Pair, Camp Counselor, and Summer Work Travel are common. Each
            category is meant to help participants enter the U.S. in a way that fosters personal growth and cultural
            interchange. The sponsor's DS-2019 form (Certificate of Eligibility) is essential, confirming the
            participant's program, stay, and J-1 visa eligibility. Employers and schools provide a practical environment
            for participants to work, study, and experience U.S. workplace culture. Cultural interchange is a key
            component of the J-1 program, encouraging participants to learn about American culture and share their own.
            SEVIS tracks J-1 participants' status, compliance, and movements during their stay to ensure the program
            meets its goals and host organizations meet regulatory requirements.
